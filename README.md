# Catan-Random-Resource-and-Number-Generator(CR-RaNG)


In "_Settlers of Catan_" when you setup, normally you place the resource hexes and the numbers "randomly". The problem is humans aren't random, at all. So wouldn't it be great if there was something that would truly randomly show how to set up the board? 

Meet CR-RaNG, formally called Catan Random Resource and Number Generator (CR-RaNG). It displays the resource abbreviations and numbers in an organized catan board shape for easy viewing and placing.
